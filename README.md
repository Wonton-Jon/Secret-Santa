# Secret-Santa
## A Secret Santa randomizer app (for Android and iOS)

Do you want to play Secret Santa with people, but have a hard time getting the name-drawing process right on the first try? Whether it be someone drawing themselves, or one person accidentally saying who they drew and spoiling it literally three times?
Well this app takes care of that! A single user needs to login to google, where each member will put their name and email address. When everyone's name has been entered, each person will receive an email saying who they will buy a present for, helping to maintain anymosity!
